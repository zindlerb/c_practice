String is an array of chars
Integer division truncates

Call by value:
    - what I am used to in most languages? - primatives immutable, collections mutable

Null character \0 used to signify the end of a string

definition - storage is allocated
declaration - variable is described. no storage is allocated

printf reference:
%d - decimal integer
%f - floating point
    %6.2f - floating point at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal.
%x - hexadecimal
%c - character
%s - character string
%ld - long integer

how does the c compiler know an int is not a pointeer?

the program will just silently die if there is a null pointer error.
